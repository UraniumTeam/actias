# Actias SDK
The main repository with Actias runtime, libraries and the loader.

Actias is a software development kit and an OS-agnostic runtime that allows developers
to write code for machines, not for operating systems.

Compile your native code once and run on any Windows or Linux machine with same processor architecture.
